It doesn\u2019t specify what the user wants the model to do, which is essential for generating relevant responses.\n\n2. **Absence of Instructions**: There are no instructions or context provided. For effective prompting, the model needs guidelines on what action or information is desired.\n\n3. **No Desired Output Specified**: There's no indication of the expected format, length, or details required in the response, leading to ambiguity.\n\n### Improved Prompt Template\n\nTo enhance the effectiveness of the prompt, here\u2019s an improved version:\n\n```markdown\nHello! Please provide a brief overview of the latest advancements in AI technology. \nThe overview should include:\n- Key innovations\n- Notable companies involved\n- Implications for various industries\n\nDesired format: \n- Bullet points for each key innovation\n- Include any crucial statistics if available.\n\nHere\u2019s an example format for the output:\n- Innovation 1: Description (Company, Year)\n- Innovation 2: Description (Company, Year)\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements\n\n1. **Clear Instruction at the Beginning**: The prompt starts with a friendly greeting but quickly shifts to a clear request about AI advancements.\n\n2. **Specific Context**: It provides context by specifying that the focus is on the latest advancements in AI technology.\n\n3. **Detailed Output Expectations**: The prompt clearly outlines what should be included in the overview and what the format should look like, making it easier for the model to generate a structured and informative response.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the prompt is likely to yield a more accurate and useful response from the model.", "prompt_a": "hi", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:31:53.222502"}

Keep the response light and engaging.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of Improvements:\n- **Specific Request**: The phrase \"Please provide a friendly introduction\" gives a clear directive.\n- **Context Provided**: Offering context about your interest in AI guides the model towards relevant details about its capabilities and applications.\n- **Engaging Tone Specified**: Asking for a \"light and engaging\" response sets the tone for how the model should present the information, improving the quality of interaction.\n\nBy following these suggestions, you\u2019ll create a prompt that elicits a more meaningful and relevant response from the model.", "prompt_a": "hi", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:47:26.386178"}

Here\u2019s a revised version:\n\n```plaintext\nPlease respond to the greeting in a friendly manner and provide a brief introduction about yourself or the topic you are programmed to assist with. \nContext: \"\"\"\nWe are starting a conversation, and I would like to know more about you and what you can do.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements\n\n1. **Explicit Request**: Instead of just \u201chi,\u201d the prompt now asks for a friendly response and a brief introduction. This clarifies the type of interaction desired.\n\n2. **Provided Context**: The context gives the model information about the nature of the conversation, making it easier for the model to respond appropriately.\n\n3. **Clear Expectations**: The prompt specifies that a brief introduction is desired, setting clear expectations for length and content.\n\nBy making the prompt clearer, more informative, and structured, we increase the chances of receiving a detailed and relevant response from the model.", "prompt_a": "hi", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:49:01.931222"}

Here are several key improvements to enhance the effectiveness of this prompt, using the best practices you've outlined:\n\n1. **Clarify the Purpose:**\n   - The prompt does not communicate any specific request or desired outcome. It's important to clearly state what you want the model to do instead of just saying \"hi.\"\n\n2. **Add Detailed Context:**\n   - Provide background information or context that the model can use to tailor its response. This is vital for generating meaningful and relevant content.\n\n3. **Use Clear Instructions:**\n   - Start with clear instructions indicating what you want the model to accomplish, followed by any necessary context. \n\n4. **Specify Output Format:**\n   - If there's a specific format or style you'd like the response to adopt, specify that as well.\n\n### Revised Prompt Template:\n\nHere's an improved version of your prompt based on the suggestions above:\n\n```plaintext\nGenerate a friendly greeting message that introduces OpenAI, highlighting its mission and recent projects. The message should be suitable for a new audience who may not be familiar with the organization. Keep it concise, engaging, and no longer than 100 words.\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements:\n- **Instructions at the Beginning:** Starts with a direct request to the model, setting a clear expectation.\n- **Detailed Context:** Specifies the subject (OpenAI) and the purpose of the message (introducing to a new audience).\n- **Specificity in Tone and Length:** Indicates the desired tone (friendly and engaging) and word count limit (100 words), which helps guide the model's response.\n  \nBy following these suggestions, the prompt is now structured to yield a more relevant and effective output from the model.", "prompt_b": "hi", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:49:10.717921"}

Here are several suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Critique and Suggestions:\n\n1. **Add Clear Instructions:**\n   - The prompt should start with a clear instruction or question that specifies what the user is looking for. For example, if the goal is to engage in a conversation, clarify the topic or what is expected.\n\n2. **Provide Context:**\n   - Context can significantly enhance the model\u2019s response. Consider setting the scene for the interaction. Is it casual, formal, or educational?\n\n3. **Specify Desired Output:**\n   - Clearly articulate what you want in terms of format or style. This could be a specific type of response, length of the answer, or tone.\n\n4. **Use Separation Formatting:**\n   - Using symbols like `###` or `\"\"\"` to separate instructions and context would help in delineating the prompt clearly.\n\n### Improved Prompt Example:\n\n```markdown\nEngage in a friendly conversation and introduce yourself. Please provide your name, a brief history about you, and one interesting fact. \nContext: \"\"\"\nI want to know more about your capabilities and how you can assist users. \nFeel free to respond in a conversational style.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Benefits of the Improved Prompt:\n\n- **Clarity:** The instructions provide a clear expectation of what to do.\n- **Context:** It sets a specific situation for the conversation.\n- **Desired Output:** By asking for specific elements (name, history, interesting fact), it encourages a more informative response.\n- **Formatting:** Using context separation improves readability and helps the model distinguish between instruction and context. \n\nBy implementing these improvements, you would be more likely to receive a comprehensive and relevant response from the model.", "prompt_a": "hi", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:05:11.628097"}

It doesn\u2019t indicate if it refers to a text, conversation, or some other form of information.\n2. **Missing Context**: There are no details about the subject or content that needs summarization. Without context, the model cannot provide an accurate or meaningful summary.\n3. **No Desired Output Format**: The prompt does not articulate how the summary should be structured (bullet points, paragraph, etc.), which can lead to inconsistent outputs.\n4. **Absence of Target Audience**: There is no mention of who the summary is intended for. This can influence the tone and detail level of the summary.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n1. **Provide Clear Instructions at the Start**: Begin with a specific instruction about the summarization task.\n2. **Add Context**: Use a clear context to specify what content needs summarizing.\n3. **Specify the Format**: Indicate how you would like the summarized content to be presented (e.g., bullet points, a paragraph, etc.).\n4. **Define the Tone or Style**: Optionally include preferences for the tone or style if applicable (e.g., formal, informal, concise, detailed).\n\n### Improved Prompt Example:\n```\nPlease summarize the following text into a bullet point list, highlighting the key points and significant details.\nText: \"\"\"\n{insert your text here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Further Enhancement Suggestion:\nIf you have a specific audience in mind or a particular aspect you want to focus on (such as implications or conclusions), you could add that too.\n\nImproved Example with Audience and Focus:\n```\nPlease provide a concise bullet point summary for a business audience, focusing on the key findings and implications of the text.\nText: \"\"\"\n{insert your text here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nThis structured prompt provides the necessary clarity and direction to obtain an effective response from the model.", "prompt_a": "summarise", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:05:56.137448"}

There\u2019s no indication of what to elaborate on or how to go about it.\n\n2. **Missing Context**: Without context, the model has no foundation to base its elaboration on. It needs to understand the topic or subject matter to provide relevant detail.\n\n3. **Undefined Output Format**: There's no specification of how the response should be structured or formatted. This leaves room for various interpretations, which could lead to an unsatisfactory result.\n\n4. **Absence of Specificity**: The prompt does not describe the desired outcome or style of elaboration. For example, whether it should be an academic explanation, a summary, or a narrative.\n\n### Suggested Improvement:\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of the prompt that incorporates all the best practices outlined:\n\n```markdown\nPlease elaborate on the topic of climate change by providing a detailed explanation, including its causes, effects, and possible solutions. \nStructure your response using the following format:\n1. Introduction\n2. Causes \n3. Effects\n4. Solutions\n5. Conclusion\n\nMake sure to provide examples where relevant and use a clear, informative style appropriate for a general audience.\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements:\n\n- **Clear Instruction**: The prompt starts with a clear directive on what the model should elaborate on (climate change).\n- **Context Provided**: The topic is explicitly stated, giving the model a clear focus.\n- **Defined Output Format**: The structure of the response is outlined, showing the model exactly how to format its response.\n- **Specificity**: Details about the style (clear and informative) and audience (general audience) guide the model on how to tailor its language and complexity.\n\nBy following these suggestions, the prompt will yield more useful, relevant, and structured results.", "prompt_b": "elaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:06:03.405664"}

It does not define the style, length, or specific focus of the summary.\n3. **No Output Format**: There is no indication of how the summary should be presented (e.g., bullet points, paragraph, etc.).\n4. **No Aim or Purpose**: It does not communicate the purpose of the summary, which might guide the model in tailoring the output.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\nTo enhance this prompt template, consider these components:\n\n1. **Provide Clear Instructions at the Beginning**: Start with a directive that includes what to summarize and how.\n2. **Use Separation for Quality and Readability**: Implement a clear distinction between instructions and context.\n3. **Be Specific and Detailed**: Include details about the summary you desire, such as length and format.\n4. **Examples of Desired Output**: If applicable, include an example structure for how you want the result to be formatted.\n\n### Improved Prompt:\nHere\u2019s a revised version of the prompt using the suggestions above:\n\n```markdown\nPlease summarize the following text into concise bullet points, highlighting key themes and main ideas. \nText: \"\"\"\n{Insert your text here}\n\"\"\"\nExample Format:\n- Key Theme 1: Description\n- Key Theme 2: Description\n- Main Idea: Description\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements:\n- **\"Please summarize the following text into concise bullet points\"**: This clearly states the desired action and format.\n- **\"highlighting key themes and main ideas\"**: This adds specificity to what the summary should focus on.\n- **Using a dedicated section for the text**: This format improves clarity and separates instructions from the content.\n- **Example Format**: Providing an example format helps the model understand how to structure the output. \n\nThese adjustments make the prompt more specific and actionable, likely leading to more satisfactory results from the model.", "prompt_a": "summarise", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:09:33.849900"}

Here are several ways to improve this prompt to enhance clarity, specificity, and ultimately the quality of the output:\n\n### Critique\n1. **Lack of Context:** The prompt does not specify the topic or subject that needs to be elaborated on. Without context, the model cannot generate a focused response.\n  \n2. **Unclear Instructions:** Simply stating \"elaborate\" does not communicate what type of elaboration is desired (e.g., detailed explanation, expanded argument, etc.).\n\n3. **Absence of Desired Format:** There is no indication of the desired output format, style, or length, which could lead to widely varying results.\n\n### Suggested Improved Prompt Template\nTo make the prompt more effective, clearly articulate the instructions, provide context, and specify the output format. Here\u2019s an improved version:\n\n---\n**Prompt:** \nElaborate on the importance of AI ethics in modern technology. Please include three key points, provide examples to support each point, and keep the response concise, around 150 words.\n\n**Context:** \n\"\"\"\nAI ethics refers to the moral implications and responsibilities associated with the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies. This encompasses issues like bias, privacy, and accountability.\n\"\"\"\n\n---\n\n### Key Improvements Explained\n1. **Clear Instruction:** The word \"elaborate\" is connected to a specific context and topic, guiding the model on what to focus on.\n  \n2. **Specified Context:** Provided context helps anchor the elaboration and ensures that the response aligns with what is expected.\n\n3. **Defined Structure and Length:** Constraints regarding the number of key points and word count help the model generate a more structured response, making it easier for the user to digest the information.\n\n4. **Examples Encouragement:** Asking for examples encourages richer, more detailed responses, improving the overall quality of the output. \n\nBy implementing these changes, the prompt will naturally lead to a more informative and well-structured response from the model.", "prompt_b": "elaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:09:40.586474"}

There\u2019s no context or subject matter provided, which leaves the model unsure of what information to expand upon.\n\n2. **Formatting**: The lack of structure and separation between instructions and context makes it less readable and harder for the model to grasp what is expected.\n\n3. **Specificity**: The prompt is not descriptive or detailed. It does not specify the type of content that requires elaboration (e.g., a concept, an argument, a text passage).\n\n4. **Desired Output**: There is no indication of how the output should be formatted or what the tone should be, making it difficult for the model to meet expectations.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\nHere\u2019s how to enhance the prompt to align with best practices:\n\n**Improved Prompt Template:**\n```\nPlease elaborate on the following topic, providing detailed explanations, examples, and relevant insights. Aim for a length of around 300 words, and ensure the tone is informative and engaging.\n\nTopic: \"\"\"\n{Insert the specific topic or text you want elaborated here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements\n1. **Clear Instruction**: The prompt starts with a clear and directive instruction, which helps guide the model on what is expected.\n\n2. **Context Specification**: Including a specific topic provides clarity and ensures the model has a clear focus for its elaboration.\n\n3. **Output Length**: Specifying the desired length gives the model a concrete target to aim for, helping to avoid overly brief or excessively long responses.\n\n4. **Tone Specification**: Stating that the tone should be \u201cinformative and engaging\u201d sets a clear expectation for the style of the response.\n\nBy applying these improvements, the model is more likely to produce a relevant, coherent, and appropriately detailed response that meets your needs.", "prompt_b": "elaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:11:11.836311"}

Applications in Cryptography\n3. Advantages over Classical Computing\n4. Conclusion\n\nWrite your elaboration below:\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Breakdown of the Revision:\n- **Clear Instructions**: The revised prompt starts with \"Please elaborate on the concept of quantum computing,\" providing a specific focus for the elaboration.\n- **Specific Aspects**: It specifies the particular applications to discuss, which guides the content direction.\n- **Audience Consideration**: Indicates that the explanation should cater to a general audience, helping to set the tone and complexity level.\n- **Formatted Output**: By providing an example structure, the model has a clear guide on how to organize the information, ensuring consistent output formatting.\n\nBy following these improvements, the prompt becomes more focused, clear, and structured, leading to more relevant and useful results from the model.", "prompt_b": "elaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:15:59.778590"}

Below are specific critiques and suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Critique:\n\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Specificity**: The prompt is vague. \"Do only theory\" does not specify what kind of theory is being referenced, the context, or the desired output. This ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and unsatisfactory results.\n\n2. **Missing Context**: There is no context provided about the subject matter or any background information, which makes it difficult for the model to provide a relevant or useful response.\n\n3. **No Clear Output Format**: The prompt does not articulate the desired output format. Without a clear indication of how the information should be organized or presented, the model may respond in an unstructured manner.\n\n4. **Instruction Placement**: There is no clear instruction label that informs the model of what it is expected to do. In line with best practices, instructions should be clearly defined and separated from any context.\n\n### Suggested Improvement:\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of the prompt that addresses these critiques:\n\n```markdown\nPlease explain the theoretical concepts of **quantum mechanics** in a clear and concise manner, focusing on the following key themes: wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and entanglement. Use bullet points for clarity and provide brief definitions or explanations for each theme. \n\nContext: \"\"\"\nQuantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales, typically at the level of particles like electrons and photons. It contrasts with classical physics in several significant ways.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements:\n\n1. **Clarity and Specificity**: The revised prompt specifies that the theory to be discussed is \"quantum mechanics\" and outlines specific themes to focus on, ensuring the response will be relevant.\n\n2. **Providing Context**: Including a brief description of quantum mechanics gives the model a foundational context to base its explanations upon.\n\n3. **Defined Output Format**: The request for bullet points clearly articulates the desired output format, making it easier for the model to structure the response appropriately.\n\n4. **Instruction Placement**: Instructions are clearly delineated from the context and formatted in a way that enhances readability and comprehension.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements, the model is more likely to deliver a coherent, relevant, and structured response aligned with your expectations.", "prompt_a": "do only theory", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:17:02.994215"}

Here's a critique of the prompt and suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Critique of Prompt A:\n1. **Lack of Instructions**: The prompt starts with \"summarise,\" which is not a clear instruction. It does not convey what should be summarized or in what format.\n   \n2. **No Context**: The prompt does not provide any context or details about the text to be summarized. This leaves the model without necessary information to generate a relevant response.\n\n3. **Output Format**: There's no indication of the desired format for the summary (e.g., bullet points, paragraph form, etc.).\n\n4. **Expectations**: The prompt does not specify the length or style of the summary, which could lead to varied and possibly unsatisfactory outputs.\n\n### Improved Prompt Template\nTo make it more effective, consider the following revised prompt structure:\n\n**Improved Prompt:**\n```\nPlease summarize the text below in bullet points, highlighting the key ideas and main themes. Make the summary concise, ideally within 5 bullet points.\nText: \"\"\"\n{insert the text to be summarized here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Justification for Improvements:\n1. **Clear Instruction**: Starting with \"Please summarize\" makes it clear what action is expected from the model.\n\n2. **Context Provided**: The placeholder `{insert the text to be summarized here}` gives the model specific content to work with.\n\n3. **Output Format**: Specifying \"in bullet points\" and detailing the desired length (ideally within 5 bullet points) clarifies the expected output format.\n\n4. **Focused on Key Elements**: Asking to \"highlight the key ideas and main themes\" directs the model's focus toward the most important information, improving the usefulness of the summary. \n\nBy implementing these changes, the prompt becomes much more effective at guiding the model towards generating a relevant and structured output.", "prompt_a": "summarise", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T16:14:44.986842"}

Here\u2019s a critique and suggestions for improvement based on the best practices you've provided:\n\n### Critique:\n1. **Clarity and Specificity**: The word \"ellaborate\" is likely a typo for \"elaborate.\" Even if it were spelled correctly, it's an unclear instruction because it does not specify what to elaborate on.\n2. **Context**: There is no context or subject matter provided. Without context, the model cannot determine what information to expand upon.\n3. **Desired Outcome**: The prompt does not indicate what the expected output should be in terms of format, style, or length.\n4. **Instructions at the Beginning**: While the prompt does start with a directive, it does not properly format the request with any supporting context.\n\n### Suggested Improvement:\nTo enhance the prompt\u2019s effectiveness, it should include clear instructions, context, and details about the expected format and output. Here's a revised version:\n\n```markdown\nElaborate on the following topic by providing a detailed explanation that includes examples and potential implications. \nTopic: \"\"\"\nThe impact of artificial intelligence on job markets.\n\"\"\"\nFormat: Please present your response in a structured manner with headings and bullet points where appropriate.\n```\n\n### Explanation of Improvements:\n1. **Clear Directive**: Starting with \"Elaborate on the following topic...\" is a clear instruction.\n2. **Context Provided**: Specifying the topic allows the model to focus on a specific area of interest.\n3. **Desired Output Format**: Asking for a \"structured manner with headings and bullet points\" sets clear expectations for how the information should be presented.\n4. **Examples and Implications**: Encouraging examples and implications enriches the response and makes it more informative. \n\nThis structure ensures that the model has a clear understanding of what you are asking and how you want the information presented, leading to a more effective and relevant output.", "prompt_b": "ellaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T16:14:55.051027"}

Without context, the model has no idea what topic or subject matter to focus on.\n\n2. **No Separation of Context**: There\u2019s no provided context from which to elaborate, making it difficult for the model to generate a relevant response.\n\n3. **No Desired Output Format**: There\u2019s no indication of how the response should be structured, whether it should be in paragraph form, bullet points, or any other specific format. \n\n### Suggested Improvement:\nHere\u2019s a revised version of the prompt that incorporates best practices:\n\n```markdown\nPlease elaborate on the importance of AI in modern education. Provide a concise overview, focusing on how AI tools can enhance learning experiences for students.\n\nContext: \"\"\"\nAI has been increasingly integrated into educational environments, offering tools such as personalized learning systems, intelligent tutoring, and administrative automation.

Three key points with explanations.\n3. A concluding thought.\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n1. **Clear Instruction**: Clearly states what to elaborate on and outlines the main topic.\n2. **Context Provided**: Gives specific context for the elaboration.\n3. **Structured Output**: Specifies the desired output format, detailing how to organize the information. \n\nBy making these adjustments, the prompt provides better guidance, enhancing the likelihood of receiving a relevant and well-structured response.", "prompt_b": "ellaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T18:30:09.687834"}

This can lead to ambiguities in response.\n\n2. **Missing Context**: There is no material or text following the instruction that indicates what content should be summarized.\n\n3. **Absence of Desired Format**: The output lacks an example or format specification, leaving the model to guess how it should structure the summary.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\nHere's how to revise the prompt to be more effective:\n\n1. **Start with Clear Instructions**: Place comprehensive instructions at the start.\n2. **Provide Context**: Introduce the text you want summarized.\n3. **Define Format and Length**: Specify how you want the summary formatted and its desired length.\n\n### Improved Prompt Example\n\n```markdown\nPlease summarize the text below into a concise bullet point list, focusing on the key ideas and main arguments. Aim for 3-5 bullet points.\n\nText: \"\"\"\n{insert text to be summarized here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Rationale for Improvements\n\n- **\"Please summarize the text below\"**: This gives a clear instruction.\n- **\"into a concise bullet point list\"**: This specifies the output format.\n- **\"focusing on the key ideas and main arguments\"**: This provides guidance on what to prioritize in the summary.\n- **\"Aim for 3-5 bullet points\"**: This indicates the expected length of the response.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the prompt becomes clearer and more directed, thereby increasing the likelihood of receiving a high-quality and relevant response.", "prompt_a": "summarise", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T18:34:58.059329"}

Without context, the model has no guidance on what content to focus on.\n \n2. **Absence of Structure**: There's no indication of the desired outcome format (e.g., bullet points, prose, etc.) or length of the summary.\n\n3. **No Context Provided**: There\u2019s no information or text provided for the model to summarize, which is essential for it to perform the task.\n\n4. **Lack of Instruction at the Beginning**: While the instruction is technically at the beginning of the prompt, it\u2019s too vague and doesn't engage the model effectively.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\nTo enhance this prompt, we can follow the best practices outlined earlier. Here\u2019s an improved version:\n\n```markdown\nPlease summarize the following text in bullet points, highlighting the main ideas and key details. \nText: \"\"\"\n{insert text that needs to be summarized here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of Improvements:\n- **Specific Instruction**: The improved version begins with a clear directive (\u201cPlease summarize the following text in bullet points...\u201d), which communicates the task explicitly.\n- **Context Provided**: The placeholder `{insert text that needs to be summarized here}` ensures that there is actual content for the model to summarize.\n- **Output Format Specified**: By asking for bullet points, the model knows exactly how to format the output.\n- **Clear Structure**: Utilizing triple quotes separates the instruction from the actual content, improving clarity.\n\nBy following these suggestions, you can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the prompt and enable the model to produce a focused and relevant summary.", "prompt_a": "summarise", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T18:38:52.275337"}

Here are some critiques and suggestions for improvement based on best practices:\n\n### Critique:\n1. **Lack of Clarity**: The term \"ellaborate\" is likely a typo for \"elaborate,\" which may confuse the model. Additionally, it's unclear what needs to be elaborated on\u2014there\u2019s no subject or context provided.\n2. **No Instruction Structure**: The prompt does not include a clear instruction at the beginning, nor does it separate instruction from context effectively.\n3. **Absence of Specificity**: The prompt does not indicate what you want to be elaborated on, which could lead to irrelevant or unsatisfactory responses.\n4. **No Desired Output Format**: There are no guidelines on how the elaboration should be presented, making it harder for the model to tailor its output appropriately.\n\n### Suggested Improvement:\nTo enhance the prompt, it should be clear, specific, and include defined instructions, context, and an output format if relevant. Here\u2019s a revised version of the prompt:\n\n```plaintext\nPlease elaborate on the topic of artificial intelligence and its impact on various industries. Consider including examples, key points, and possible future trends.\n\nContext: \"\"\"\nArtificial intelligence, often referred to as AI, is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Why This Improvement Works:\n1. **Clear Instruction**: It starts with a direct command, making it clear what is expected.\n2. **Separated Context**: It uses triple quotes to separate instructions from context, following best practices.\n3. **Specific Context**: It provides a specific topic to elaborate on, allowing the model to focus its response.\n4. **Expected Detail**: It encourages the inclusion of examples and key points, guiding the model towards a more comprehensive output.\n\nOverall, this improves clarity and helps the model provide a more targeted and relevant response.", "prompt_b": "ellaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T18:38:59.965722"}

Additionally, structure the response with clear headings and bullet points for easy readability.\n\nContext: \"\"\"\nRenewable energy is becoming increasingly important in addressing climate change and energy security issues. I would like a comprehensive overview that discusses solar and wind energy specifically.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Key Improvements\n\n- **Clear Instructions**: Starts with a clear instruction to \"elaborate on the topic of renewable energy sources,\" making it specific.\n- **Context Provided**: Gives a brief context to guide the response.\n- **Desired Output Format**: Indicates how the information should be structured for clarity and ease of understanding.\n- **Specific Focus**: Directs attention to specific aspects like \"benefits of solar and wind energy\" and requests statistics, giving the model a clear direction.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements, the prompt becomes much more effective in guiding the model towards producing a detailed and relevant response.", "prompt_b": "ellaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T18:45:04.744166"}

Here's a critique of Prompt B and suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Critique:\n1. **Lack of Clarity**: The term \"ellaborate\" is unclear as it is misspelled and does not indicate what needs to be elaborated on. It's vital to specify the subject or context that requires elaboration.\n\n2. **Absence of Structure**: The prompt does not utilize a structured format, making it challenging for the AI to understand how to respond.\n\n3. **No Desired Outcome**: It does not articulate what kind of details or aspects should be elaborated upon (e.g., an argument, a topic, an idea).\n\n4. **Formatting**: There is no indication of how you want the response formatted or structured. Listing examples or desired output formats would improve understanding.\n\n### Suggested Improvement:\nTo enhance this prompt, begin with clear instructions, specify the topic for elaboration, and define the desired output format. Here\u2019s an improved version:\n\n```markdown\nElaborate on the benefits of using artificial intelligence in healthcare, providing detailed examples and explanations for each benefit. Please format the response as a numbered list.\n\nTopics to cover may include:\n1. Enhanced diagnostics\n2. Personalized medicine\n3. Operational efficiency\n```\n\nBy incorporating these changes:\n- **Instructions**: The request to \"Elaborate on\" gives a clear action.\n- **Specificity**: Defining \"artificial intelligence in healthcare\" focuses the elaboration.\n- **Desired Format**: Outlining the format as a numbered list helps to structure the response.\n\nThis revised prompt provides clarity, encourages a more focused response, and facilitates better guiding from the model.", "prompt_b": "ellaborate", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T18:46:29.731379"}

This results in ambiguity that can hinder the model's effectiveness. Here\u2019s a critique and suggestions for improvement based on the best practices outlined:\n\n### Critique of Prompt A:\n1. **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The prompt only contains \"ds,\" which does not convey any specific task or instruction to the model. It\u2019s unclear what \"ds\" stands for or what action is to be taken.\n   \n2. **No Context Provided**: There is no information given to the model about what data or content pertains to \"ds,\" which means the model cannot generate meaningful responses.\n\n3. **Absence of Desired Output Format**: There\u2019s no indication of how you want the output to be structured or presented. A well-defined format would guide the model to deliver results in a usable manner.\n\n### Revised Prompt Template:\nTo improve the prompt, you can follow the best practices and structure it more effectively as follows:\n\n```markdown\nPlease provide a comprehensive analysis of the term \"ds\". Include its definition, potential applications, and relevant examples.\nText: \"\"\"\nds\n\"\"\"\nOutput Format: \n\"\"\"\n{\n  \"Definition\": \"Definition of ds\",\n  \"Applications\": [\"Application 1\", \"Application 2\", ...],\n  \"Examples\": [\n    {\n      \"Example\": \"First example of ds\",\n      \"Explanation\": \"Brief explanation of the example\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements:\n1. **Clear Instructions**: The prompt starts with a specific instruction, clarifying that you want an analysis, which helps set expectations.\n  \n2. **Context**: The actual term \"ds\" is provided after the initial instruction as context, making it clear what is to be analyzed.\n\n3. **Detailed Output Format**: The expected output format is shown clearly with placeholders for the definition, applications, and examples. This guides the model in structuring the response appropriately.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the prompt becomes more specific, descriptive, and ultimately likely to yield better and more relevant results from the model.", "prompt_b": "ds", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T20:15:14.411671"}

Here\u2019s a detailed critique along with suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Critique of Prompt A:\n\n1. **Lack of Instructions**: The prompt has no clear instructions indicating what the model is supposed to do. There\u2019s no guidance on what type of output is expected (summary, extraction, transformation, etc.).\n\n2. **Missing Context**: The prompt is completely blank, failing to provide the text or context that the model should work with. Without any input, the model can't generate meaningful responses.\n\n3. **No Desired Output Format**: There are no examples or specifications regarding how the output should be structured or formatted. This can lead to variable results that may not meet the user\u2019s expectations.\n\n4. **Absence of Specificity**: The prompt doesn\u2019t describe the subject matter, tone, or style, making it unclear what kind of content the user wants. \n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. **Provide Clear Instructions**: Start the prompt with specific directives to inform the model about the task. This should clearly articulate the nature of the output you seek.\n\n2. **Include Contextual Information**: Insert the text or information that needs to be processed after the instructions. This gives the model the necessary material to work with.\n\n3. **Define the Output Format**: Specify how you want the model to present the output. This could include JSON formatting, bullet points, paragraphs, etc. Offering examples helps clarify expectations.\n\n4. **Add Details to Specify the Outcome**: Include details regarding the desired style, tone, or length for the output, which can help guide the model's responses more effectively.\n\n### Improved Prompt Example:\n\nHere is an improved version based on the recommended best practices:\n\n```\nPlease extract relevant entities mentioned in the text below and format them into a JSON array. Each object in the array should contain the keys \"Company Name,\" \"Person Name,\" \"Topics,\" and \"Themes,\" populated with the corresponding information from the text. \n\nText: \"\"\"\nOpenAI recently launched GPT-4, and Sam Altman discussed its impact on AI safety and machine learning research. Other companies like Google and Microsoft are also exploring similar technologies, focusing on advancements in AI applications.\n\"\"\"\n\nOutput format example:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Company Name\": \"OpenAI\",\n    \"Person Name\": \"Sam Altman\",\n    \"Topics\": [\"GPT-4\", \"AI safety\", \"machine learning\"],\n    \"Themes\": [\"AI applications\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"Company Name\": \"Google\",\n    \"Person Name\": null,\n    \"Topics\": [],\n    \"Themes\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"Company Name\": \"Microsoft\",\n    \"Person Name\": null,\n    \"Topics\": [],\n    \"Themes\": []\n  }\n]\n```\n```\n\nThis revised prompt clearly instructs the model, includes specific context to work with, provides a clear format for the output, and specifies a comprehensive structure.

Here are some ways to enhance it:\n\n### Critique of Prompt A:\n\n1. **Clarity and Detail**: While the prompt mentions key features (battery life, comfort, sound quality), it lacks specifics about what values or metrics should be highlighted. For instance, rather than just mentioning \"battery life,\" including a specific duration (e.g., \"up to 30 hours\") would provide more context.\n\n2. **Stylistic Guidance**: The prompt doesn't specify a desired tone or style. Indicating whether the description should be formal, casual, or aspirational could help tailor the output to better fit marketing needs.\n\n3. **Target Audience**: Including information about the target audience (e.g., professionals, travelers, audiophiles) can guide the language and focus of the description.\n\n4. **Formatting Requirements**: It would be beneficial to clarify the output format, even if just to request a paragraph. Adding specific elements expected in the description can improve the targeted response.\n\n5. **Examples**: Providing an example of what a well-crafted product description might look like could give the model a clearer framework to follow.\n\n### Suggested Improved Prompt:\n\n```\nCreate a compelling promotional paragraph (3\u20134 sentences) for a new model of wireless noise-canceling headphones. Highlight the key features including: battery life (up to 30 hours), ultra-soft ear cushions for exceptional comfort, and premium sound quality with deep bass and clear highs. Use an engaging and aspirational tone, targeting tech-savvy professionals who value high-performance audio. Conclude with an enticing call to action encouraging customers to experience the difference.\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n\n- **Specific Metrics**: Includes specific metrics like \"up to 30 hours\" for battery life.\n- **Tone Guidance**: Specifies an engaging and aspirational tone.\n- **Target Audience**: Identifies the target demographic (tech-savvy professionals).\n- **Structure Preference**: Emphasizes the promotional nature of the paragraph while maintaining a clear starting and closing format for focus. \n\nBy incorporating these elements, the prompt will yield more targeted and effective product descriptions.", "prompt_a": "Produce a short promotional paragraph (3\u20134 sentences) that highlights the key features of a new wireless noise-canceling headphone, including battery life, comfort, and sound quality.

Here are some critiques along with suggestions for enhancement:\n\n### Critique\n\n1. **Clarity in Instructions**: While the instruction is clear, it can be more direct about the tone or perspective (e.g., neutral, analytical) that the summary should take.\n  \n2. **Contextual Information**: The prompt does not specify the source or nature of the article (e.g., journalistic, opinion, academic), which can affect how a summary is framed.\n\n3. **Output Format**: The prompt lacks specificity regarding the format of the output. A one-sentence summary can vary widely, so it may help to provide an example or describe the level of detail expected.\n\n4. **Length Specification**: \"Concise\" is somewhat subjective; specifying a word or character limit could enhance clarity.\n\n### Improved Prompt Template\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your prompt that incorporates the above suggestions:\n\n```markdown\nPlease provide a concise, one-sentence summary of the following article that captures its main event and outcome. The summary should be neutral in tone and approximately 20-30 words in length. \n\nArticle text: \"\"\"\n{article text here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\nIf desired, you could also provide an example of an acceptable summary to further clarify expectations. For instance:\n\n```markdown\nExample of an acceptable summary: \n\"The launch of OpenAI's new DALL-E model has transformed the capabilities of AI-generated images, allowing users to create art from text descriptions.\"\n```\n\nOverall, these enhancements aim to ensure that the model fully understands the task and provides a summary that meets your specific needs.", "prompt_a": "Provide a concise, one\u2010sentence summary of the following article that captures its main event and outcome:", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T21:51:23.675926"}

Providing a specific format will help guide the model's response.\n  \n2. **Context Clarity**: The instruction could be enhanced by identifying the purpose of extracting keywords, which may help the model focus on the most relevant terms.\n  \n3. **Lack of model-specific context**: Mentioning the model or providing any contextual information about the passage could help in better aligning the response with what you are expecting.\n\n4. **Use of Separation Symbols**: It is good practice to separate instructions from context for clarity.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\nHere\u2019s a revised version of the prompt that incorporates the identified areas for improvement:\n\n```markdown\nExtract three important keywords from the following passage. Please provide them in a simple list format (e.g., keyword1, keyword2, keyword3), without any additional explanation.\n\nPassage: \"\"\"\n{insert passage here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- By stating \"simple list format,\" it encourages a structured response while remaining clear and direct.\n- Always make sure to provide the actual text in the designated section so that the model has the content to analyze.\n- If there are specific criteria that determine what is considered \"important,\" you could also mention those for added clarity (e.g., \u201ckeywords should be the most relevant terms related to the main topic\u201d).\n- You might consider identifying the audience or context in which the keywords may be used, as this could influence their selection.\n\nBy applying these modifications, the prompt will likely yield more accurate and relevant outcomes.", "prompt_b": " List three important keywords from the following passage (just the words, no additional explanation):\n", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T21:51:30.449403"}

Here is the text of the article:\n\"\"\"\n{article text here}\n\"\"\"\nFor example: \"The local council approved the new recycling initiative, aiming to reduce waste by 40% over the next two years.\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Instruction Clarity**: I've maintained the instruction at the beginning and added a request for a \"formal tone.\"\n- **Context Addition**: Specifying that the article is a news article helps guide the model's understanding of the expected type of summary.\n- **Example Provided**: By including a clear example of the expected output, you give the model a template to work from, aiding in better and more tailored results.", "prompt_a": "Provide a concise, one\u2010sentence summary of the following article that captures its main event and outcome:", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T21:56:34.777680"}

Ensure that the summary is clear and informative, suitable for a general audience. \nArticle: \"\"\"\n{insert article text here}\n\"\"\"\nExample Output: \"The [Main Event] resulted in [Outcome], illustrating [Additional Insight or Context].\"\n```\n\n### Breakdown of Improvements:\n1. **Clear Instruction**: The instruction is clear and direct.\n2. **Context Separation**: Using triple quotes clearly separates the article text from the instructions.\n3. **Output Example**: The example output provides a clear template for what the summary should resemble, guiding the model more effectively.\n4. **Audience Consideration**: Mentioning the audience (\"suitable for a general audience\") sets the expected complexity and style for the summary.\n\nOverall, these improvements will enhance the model's ability to produce a summary that meets your expectations.", "prompt_a": "Provide a concise, one\u2010sentence summary of the following article that captures its main event and outcome:", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T21:58:54.469948"}

For example, if you want the AI to summarize, provide an overview, or generate ideas, make that explicit.\n\n2. **Include Context**: If there is specific information or text the AI should consider, include it. This is essential to guide the model effectively.\n\n3. **Specify Output Format**: Indicate the desired format for the output, whether it's a list, paragraph, code, etc. Providing an example can be very helpful.\n\n### Revised Prompt Example:\n\nHere\u2019s a more effective version of the prompt:\n\n```plaintext\nPlease provide a response that addresses the query.\nContext: \"\"\"\nWhat are the key factors influencing climate change?\n\"\"\"\nOutput Format: \n1.

Here's a critique of the prompt and suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Critique:\n1. **Lack of Instructions**: The prompt starts with a negative directive, which may confuse the model about what is actually desired. \n2. **Absence of Context**: There is no context provided. The model won't know what content to analyze or which specific task to perform instead of summarizing.\n3. **No Desired Output Format**: Without specifying the desired format of the response, the model might produce results that are not in line with what the user expects.\n4. **Unclear Objectives**: The prompt does not articulate what the user really wants the model to do; merely instructing it *not* to summarize is not constructive.\n\n### Improved Prompt:\nTo enhance the prompt, we should clearly state the intended task while providing context and an example of the desired output format. Here\u2019s a revised version:\n\n```\nPlease analyze the following text and identify key insights without providing a summary. Focus on the main themes and implications. Respond in a structured format, like so:\n\nInsights:\n1. [Insight 1]\n2. [Insight 2]\n3. [Insight 3]\n\nText: \"\"\"\n{insert your text here}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n1. **Positive Directive**: The prompt begins with a clear instruction on what to do (\"please analyze the following text and identify key insights\").\n2. **Context Provided**: The model now knows to analyze the text, which gives it a specific task.\n3. **Desired Output Format**: By providing an example format, the model will understand how to structure its output.\n4. **Clarity on Not Summarizing**: The request for insights makes it clear that summarizing is not the goal, which is now framed positively. \n\nBy implementing these changes, the improved prompt becomes more effective and will likely yield better results from the model.", "prompt_b": "Do not provide me a summary", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T22:00:59.022735"}

This could help improve clarity.\n   \n2. **Vagueness in Desired Output**: While it asks for a concise summary, the term \"concise\" could be defined further in terms of word count (e.g., 20-30 words) or examples of what types of events and outcomes to focus on.\n\n3. **Absence of Specificity**: The prompt could benefit from additional details on what kind of writing style or tone is preferred (e.g., formal, informal, analytical) to ensure the summary fits the intended use.\n\n4. **Example Guidance**: There\u2019s no example of the desired output format included, which might help the model better understand how to structure the response.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n1. **Add a Clear Separator**: Use a structured format to separate instructions from the content. For example, use \u201c###\u201d to delineate.\n\n2. **Define \u201cConcise\u201d**: Specify the maximum word count for the summary to give clearer guidance on the length.\n\n3. **Specify Tone and Style**: Include an instruction regarding the tone or style of the summary.\n\n4. **Provide an Example**: Include an example of a one-sentence summary to guide the model on expected output format.\n\n### Revised Prompt Template:\n```\nPlease provide a concise summary (20-30 words) of the following article that captures its main event and outcome, using a formal tone.\nArticle Text: ###\n{Insert article text here}\nExample Summary: \"The main event in the article was [event], resulting in [outcome].\"\n```\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the revised prompt provides clearer instruction, better structure, and illustrates the expected output, enhancing the likelihood of receiving a high-quality response.", "prompt_a": "Provide a concise, one\u2010sentence summary of the following article that captures its main event and outcome:", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T22:08:14.923602"}

For example, if you want an analysis, a discussion, or a detailed explanation, make that clear at the beginning.\n2. **Include Context**: Introduce the text or topic that you want the model to work with. This gives the model the necessary information to generate a relevant response.\n3. **Define Output Format**: If there is a particular format or style you want the output to follow, include that as well. For example, specify if you need it in bullet points, JSON format, or as a narrative.\n\n### Improved Prompt Template:\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your prompt:\n\n```\nPlease provide a detailed analysis based on the text provided below, avoiding any summarization.

It's generally more effective to specify the desired outcome rather than what should be avoided.\n  \n2. **Lack of Context**: There is no context or information about what is expected in place of a summary. This can result in irrelevant responses or confusion about the intended focus.\n\n3. **Absence of Format Specification**: The prompt does not communicate how the user wants the information to be presented or structured.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve:\n\n1. **Add Positive Instructions**: Clearly state what the desired output should be, instead of only what it shouldn't be.\n\n2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant details or content to guide the model. \n\n3. **Specify the Format**: If there is a preferred format for the output, this should be included in the prompt.\n\n### Improved Prompt:\n\nHere's a revised version of the prompt incorporating these suggestions:\n\n```plaintext\nPlease provide a detailed analysis of the text below, focusing on the key themes and insights without summarizing. \nText: \"\"\"\n{Insert the text here}\n\"\"\"\nFormat: \n- Key Theme 1: Explanation\n- Key Theme 2: Explanation\n- Key Insight: Explanation\n```\n\n### Explanation of Improvements:\n- **Clear Instruction**: The prompt now instructs the model to perform a specific task (an analysis) rather than just avoiding a summary.\n- **Context Provided**: Replacing the summary with a request for an analysis suggests a different way to engage with the material.\n- **Specific Format**: By outlining how the analysis should be structured, the model can follow clear guidelines to fulfill the request effectively.", "prompt_b": "Do not provide me a summary", "timestamp": "2025-06-02T22:15:56.732234"}
